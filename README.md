## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- OOCSS methodology

### What I learned

This was an interesting project when it comes to card positioning. I decided to go with CSS Grid because of *grid-template* and *grid-area* properties. I improved skills responsible for decision-making before starting a project. I believe I went with optimal approach to this project, but how knows, maybe I'll give it another thought after some time pass.

### Continued development

I definitely want to use more of CSS Grid in my project. When I'll see that it's a good fit, I want to use this tool as much as I can to get a better understanding then I have at this moment.
